# Adobe Bridge Custom Metadata JSON GLAM Presets


Set of presets to read and write GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives & Museums) metadata, for "Custom Metadata Panel for Bridge" [https://github.com/adobe-dmeservices/custom-metadata]


Currently the DC & ISAD(G) presets are published and soon I hope to create presets for EAD, DC, SPECTRUM, VRA & more.

Many thanks for your feedback !
