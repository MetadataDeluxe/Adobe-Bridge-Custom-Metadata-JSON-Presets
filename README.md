# Adobe Bridge Custom Metadata JSON GLAM Presets


Set of presets to read and write GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives & Museums) metadata, for "Custom Metadata Panel for Bridge" [https://github.com/adobe-dmeservices/custom-metadata]


Currently the DC, ISAD(G), Photoshop, xmpRights & VRA Essential XMP presets are published and soon I hope to create presets for EAD, DC, SPECTRUM, VRA & more.

Thanks a lot for your feedback !

### Notes
#### **VRA Essential XMP**
 is a simplified version of VRA Core using only the display properties and six user-defined custom properties. The namespace is "http://www.vraweb.org/vracore/4.0/essential/" and the preferred prefix is "vrae".
Documentation of the complete VRA Core standard can be found at http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/
